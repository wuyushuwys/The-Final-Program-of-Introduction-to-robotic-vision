# The-Final-Program-of-Introduction-to-robotic-vision
It's the final program of introduction to robot, using the toolbox of rvctools via peter corke. This program aims to determine the camera's pose changing from to picture.\<br>
Before you running this program, you should have downloaded toolbox from http://petercorke.com/wordpress/.\<br>
This progame is editting and debuging under Matlab R2014a. Any version older than it might meet some unpredictable errors.\<br>
